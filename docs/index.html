                <h3>High levels of competence</h3>
                My main focus has been on ML style functional programming with <b>F#</b> and <b>Haskell</b> and I've
                been doing it on my own time since 2014 until I got to work with it professionally. While I'm very
                comfortable with FP it's safe to say there is still a lot more to learn. It's a very rich subject.

                Through study of <b>Structure and Interpretation of Computer Programs</b> and <b>The Reasoned
                    Schemer</b> I've been experimenting with relational programming on my own time in <b>Scheme</b> and
                would jump at the chance to work with a logic programming language like <b>Mercury</b> or <b>Prolog</b>
                if given the opportunity.

                <h3>Medium levels of competence</h3>
                I'm no 3D artist but more of a 3D technician. I've been doing 3D modelling since I was twelve but I have
                no artistic skill. When I started programming I quickly learned <b>OpenGL</b> and <b>WebGL</b>.
                Currently I'm working on teaching myself <b>Vulkan</b>.
